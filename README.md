# Darkroom Roller
Arduino Nano project to drive a stepper motor on a timer, for making darkroom prints with drums

## TODO:
 - make v2 pcb with changes

 - fix led resistors so they show up (330->220?)
 - why stepper no work?
    - bad wiring?  Looks ok
    - burned out board?
    - bad connection to motor? no
    - bad code?  I don't think so....

 - potential bug with timer not fully reseting
